### Last Lab Instructions

- Every time a member does anything in the code he should commit the changes and push them into his corresponding branch even if the code is not working so other members can see the progress done in the corresponding task.

- When commiting changes into the code the commit message should refer to the changes done in the code and not leave the commit message empty. 

- A pull request is not done until the task is fully finished and the code should be merged into the main branch.

#### ! Any Member who finished his work should inform others so he take another task if possible

# ! Important(read the following instructions)  
## Task Workflow

• Every member should create branches and put their work in a folder with the task's name before doing any task.  
• Each member should put understandable comments on their code.

• Inform other team members when submitting a pull requeast if not noticed.  

## Additional Requirements
